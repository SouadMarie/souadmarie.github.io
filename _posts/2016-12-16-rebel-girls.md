I heard about a super cool project that I wanted to share about: <a href="https://www.rebelgirls.co/" target="_blank">rebel girls</a>.

These 2 women want to change the way we tell stories to our girls. In fact, the "familiar" stories are full of gender stereotypes and it's so old fashion. I mean, have you ever thought about the snow white story? The girl is lost, she is finding a house in the middle of nowhere and she starts to …. Clean. 

Anyway, they wrote the coolest book called “Good Nights Stories For Rebel Girls” featuring women who achieved something like Frida Kahlo, Serena Williams, Virginia Woolf,  Amna Al Haddad and more. 

I will literally buy it during my next trip to the US even if I don’t have kids yet. 

“We are all wonderwomen!”
