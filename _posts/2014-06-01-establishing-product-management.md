<i>Luxola was a beauty e-commerce platform that has been acquired by Sephora - as Sephora Digital in July 2015.</i>

<p>When I joined Luxola, there were only 2 software developers in the tech team and everything needed to be done in term of product management and team structure.</p>

<p>In less than 6 months, the team grew by 4 times and we have implemented a real lean &amp; agile process inside the tech team and with the other departments.  When I left the company, we had a proper structure composed of: UX designers, front &amp; back-end engineers, product managers and data engineers/analysts. Finally, our productivity have improved by 150% (we’ve used the point tracking system of pivotal tracker)</p>

<p>And here is what I have done to implement a product lifecycle management:</p>

<strong>Evangelising lean & agile process in other departments</strong>

<p>First of all, I had to communicate with all the teams to explain the purpose of a lean &amp; agile process. What will they gain from this process? Why should they change? 
Therefore, I took the time to listen and discuss with the different stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development (published in 2001) states the following: “The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.” </p>

<strong>Product organisation</strong>

<p>Product management is all about roadmap. I arrived on an existing product - so I’ve spent time with the engineers to understand what needed to be done. </p>

<p>How to prioritise and organise your roadmap? </p>

<p>We’ve used post-its to sum-up all the remaining tickets. Together with the engineers, I’ve organised these tickets by products and projects. Then, we’ve defined our prioritise depending on the user and revenue impacts. Once, we were done, we just planned our first sprint &amp; releases! </p>

<strong> Ticketing Support </strong>

<p>To keep how prioritisation and handle the requests from the differents stakeholders, we’ve implemented a ticketing system called freshdesk. In order to have the best response time, we have also create a technical support team. This team was in charge to handle all the tickets: anything that could be done on the spot was done by this team, any other requests were sent to the product team. </p>

<strong> Real Analytics </strong>

<p>We’ve decided to implement a lean and agile process, which means that we wanted to be fast AND we wanted to test in order to take decisions based on data.</p>

<p>To do so, we had to create a data strategy and we have built the data engineer team. The whole company was working with them &amp; the BI analysts, to have data insights. On the product side, we were working closely with them to implement tracking on the website, AB test scenarii, competitors analysis and consumer analysis. </p>

<strong> Conceptualise solutions </strong>

<p> Once we’ve validated our first problems and define our first KPI, the job was just getting started: we had to conceptualise solutions! We’ve created a team of UX designers, in order for the product team to work closely with them to prototyping solutions. </p>

<strong> Build the team </strong>

<p> As we were growing, we needed to grow the technical team &amp; product team to handle our several products: e-commerce engine, in-house CMS, in-house warehouse management system and in-house marketing management tool.  </p>
