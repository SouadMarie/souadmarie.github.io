<i>Luxola was a beauty e-commerce platform that has been acquired by Sephora - as Sephora Digital in July 2015.</i>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p> Our mobile conversion rate were falling below market standard despite a growth of ~30% in our mobile traffic. In fact, we did not think with a consumer mindset and we were not considering mobile technology and functionalities, hence we were not mobile-friendly. </p>

<h2> How to fix it? </h2>

<strong> Customer Focus </strong>

<p>First, we’ve redefined our target and did some researches about our consumers. Here are some keys informations about consumer opinion on mobile-optimized website:</p>
<ul>
    <li>54% - better access to information</li>
    <li>48% - will spend more time on a mobile optimized site</li>
    <li>37% - more likely to purchase</li>
    <li>25% - more secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to these researches, we had a better ideas of :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who is our target (we have developed few personas)</li>
    <li>How there were using their mobile</li>
    <li>What our target was expecting on our website</li>
</ul>
<p>We have organised a focus group (3 groups of 5 people) with the old and new version. The selected customer for these groups were representative of our personas realised during the phase 1. Here are some key facts:</p>
<p>Thanks to these researches, we had a better ideas of :</p>
<table>
    <thead>
        <th>Test</th>
        <th>Before</th>
        <th>After</th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Find a product by references</td>
            <td>avg 8 clicks</td>
            <td>avg 4 clicks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Find a product by references</td>
            <td>avg 8 clicks</td>
            <td>avg 4 clicks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Product description difficult</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Focus checkout until confirmation</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>18</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
<table>

<strong>Focus on mobile functionalities</strong>

<p>We’ve focus our KPI on 3 areas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search Optimization</li>
    <li>Content</li>
    <li>Easy Checkout </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to improve them, we have implemented different features like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bigger search bar</li>
    <li>Smart Filtering</li>
    <li>Cross Selling</li>
    <li>Infinity Scroll</li>
    <li>Instant purchase</li>
</ul>
 

<h2> Results </h2>

<p> We have launched our new mobile website in February. Today, we can say that we improved the conversion rate by around 5%, we reduced the bounce rate by around 15%, we improved the AOV by around 10%, customers take 50% less time to find what they want, and customers see 100% more products. The only negative result we witnessed was the decrease in search bar use, whereas we wanted it to grow. </p>
