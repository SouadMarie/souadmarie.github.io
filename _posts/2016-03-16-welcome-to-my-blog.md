I am starting this blog to share about my passions, work and some thoughts. Why should you read me?

Few reasons:
- I am not doing this for the fame
- I will be cruelly honest
- I will try to be funny
- You can tell me when I am wrong 

I have a few years of experience in startups and even if people evangelize this fact, I want to share with you the whole truth and everything you need to know. 

Product manager and software developer, I will share some tips that helped me through my work and I hope, it will help you too. 

"Stay positive, work hard, make it happen"
