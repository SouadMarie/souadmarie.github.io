<i>The New Luncher is the first online lunchbox delivery service for children in Singapore. Easy online subscription for parents, the team prepares healthy and tasty lunches for kids and deliver them to the schools everyday.</i>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p> We needed to develop a technical infrastructure to support our project: a delivery service for kids at school. In the form of a monthly subscription, the parents can subscribe online the first time and then, we will generate a personalized meal plan each month with an automatic payment.  </p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<strong>Market Researches</strong>

<p>While working on defining the concept and our offer, we’ve made some researches about our indirect competitors (Singapore & Research) and user group of parents. Our goal was to understand our market and define the best offer.</p>

<strong>User Flow Touchpoints</strong>

<p>Our product could only work if we had a proper understanding of our process and a vision of how we will do it. We needed to know all our customer contact points. </p>

<strong> Infrastructure conceptualisation </strong>

<p>Once I had a better understanding of the big picture and the future of the company, it was easier to imagine a scalable technical infrastructure to bring the concept to live.</p>

<p>The goal is to give the control to the parents on what their kids eat. We will track for them from where the tomato come to which kid will eat it. We will tell them in real time when the kid eat.</p>

<p>The infrastructure, called Ratatouille, is composed of several products whose the e-commerce engine. Each product answers a different need for the process &amp; business. We’ve have started with our e-commerce engine as it will be our revenue generator. We’ve called this product: Eggplant.</p>


<strong> Prototype </strong>

<p>We have started the whole project by wireframing on paper the whole website. Why paper? Because I love to start on a white page and I found it easier to change &amp; exchange on with different actors. How I wireframes? For each page, I define the key informations and then I place them on my page depending on the importance. </p>

<p>At this stage, when the user flow was understood and agreed with everyone. I’ve started to work on the “how” - meaning which technology to have the best result? I’ve decided to go with Python (django framework) and AngularJS.  I will write another post about the technology. </p>

<p>After few weeks, we had our first real prototype ready and we’ve organised another focus group with external actors this time. In fact, starting something new, you have no data … you can “only” use the people and intuition knowing that you might wrong. </p>


<h2>Result</h2>

<p> We are live and generating our first sales! </p>
